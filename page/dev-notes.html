        <h2>Open to feedback</h2>
        <p>
            I tend to design websites to my liking--clean, simple, high-contrast--but this isn't <em>my</em> project, so I really want to hear what vision other people have for the website. I have a to-do list for myself here, but lmk if you want to see a feature added that I might not think of.
        </p>
        <h2>Plans / to-do</h2>
        <h3>Finish Pages</h3>
        <p>I'm copying things directly from the document as they are--making the website was already a big commitment for me.
        <h3>Dark Mode Toggle</h3>
        <p>I reused the dark mode toggle that I already built for the math wiki, but I'm actually thinking about repurposing the feature to a 'High Contrast' mode for our low-vision friends. Plus, that'd let me just design the normal site to just look however I want         <caption> (building a 3-way color system would not be a good use of time).</caption></p>
